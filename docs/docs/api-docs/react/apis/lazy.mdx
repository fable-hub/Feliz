`React.lazy` lets you define components that are loaded dynamically, enabling code-splitting and improving performance by only loading components when needed. Lazy components must be rendered inside a `Suspense` boundary to handle loading states.

## `[<ReactLazyComponent>]` attribute

This is the recommended way to define lazy components in Feliz. The attribute automatically wraps the component in `React.lazy` and ensures correct transpilation.

Check out the [ReactLazyComponent documentation](../../feliz/react-component.mdx#reactlazycomponent) for more details.

## React.lazy'

`React.lazy'` is a lower-level API that allows you to define lazy components.

To ensure correct rendering:
- use `React.lazy'` to define lazy components and `React.lazyRender` to render them.
- `React.lazy'` must be used as `let`-binding to ensure correct transpilation as `const` in JavaScript.

import SuspenseDemo from '../../../feliz-docs/fableoutput/Examples/React/Suspense'
import RawSuspenseDemo from '!!raw-loader!../../../feliz-docs/Examples/React/Suspense.fs'

<ComponentRender code={RawSuspenseDemo}>
  <SuspenseDemo />
</ComponentRender>
