    - Check out the section below to find the most important instructions for setting up your development environment.
3. ✨ Make your changes and ensure that you follow the coding style and conventions used in the project. (Styling should be automatically applied by Fantomas if you use VS Code with Ionide)
4. ✅ Write tests for your changes to ensure that they work as expected and do not introduce any regressions.

# Workflows

Feliz uses a f# build project to run common tasks such as testing. You can find the entrypoint for the build project under `./build/Build.fsproj`.

> [!TIP]
> **On Windows** you can also use `.\build.cmd` to run the build tasks instead of `dotnet run --project ./build/Build.fsproj`.
> **On MacOS/Linux** you can also use `./build.sh` to run the build tasks instead of `dotnet run --project ./build/Build.fsproj`.

## Testing

```bash
dotnet run --project ./build/Build.fsproj test
```

## Run docs

1. Go into docs folder:

    ```bash
    cd docs
    ```

2. Start docs server:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
